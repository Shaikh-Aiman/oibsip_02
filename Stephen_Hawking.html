                <em>STEPHEN HAWKING</em>
            </h1>  
<p>  
    British cosmologist <strong>Stephen William Hawking</strong> was born in Oxford, England on <strong>8-JANUARY-1942</strong> [300 years to the day after the death of the astronomer Galileo Galilei] and died on <strong>14-MARCH-2018</strong>[at the age of 76,the cause of his death was complications related to his long-term battle with ALS].<br>
    He attended University College, Oxford, where he studied physics, despite his father's urging to focus on medicine. Hawking went on to Cambridge to research cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole.
    <br>
    
    <h3><u><heading>EARLY LIFE</heading></u></h3>
    In early 1963, just shy of his 21st birthday,<em>Hawking was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</em>.
    Doctors told Hawkings that he would likely not survive more than two years with the disease. Completing his doctorate did not appear likely, but <strong>Hawking defied the odds</strong>.
    He also obtained his PhD in 1966 for his thesis entitled <u>"Properties of expanding universes"</u>.<br><br>
    As the disease spread, Hawking became less mobile and began using a wheelchair. Talking grew more challenging and, in 1985, an emergency tracheotomy caused his total loss of speech. A speech-generating device constructed at Cambridge, combined with a software program, served as his electronic voice, allowing Hawking to select his words by moving the muscles in his cheek.
            
    <h3><u><heading>MARRIAGE</heading></u></h3>
    Just before his diagnosis, Hawking met Jane Wilde, and the two were married in 1965. The couple had three children before separating in 1990. Hawking remarried in 1995 to Elaine Mason but divorced in 2006.<br>
            
    <h3><u><heading>RESEARCH & STUDY</heading></u></h3>
    Hawking's research focused primarily on the fields of cosmology, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. He made <em>significant contributions to our understanding of the universe, particularly in the areas of black holes and the Big Bang theory</em>.<br><br>
    
    <u>Hawking Radiation:</u>One of Hawking's most famous contributions to physics is the theoretical prediction of what is now known as "Hawking radiation". <em>In 1974, he proposed that black holes emit radiation</em>, eventually leading to their evaporation. This groundbreaking idea challenged previous notions about the behavior of black holes. <br><br>
            
    <strong>Throughout his career, Hawking proposed several theories regarding astronomical anomalies, posed curious questions about the cosmos and enlightened the world about the origin of everything.</strong>        
    <br>
    
    <h3><u><heading>BOOKS</heading></u></h3>
    In the last three decades of Hawking's life, he not only continued to publish academic literature, but he also published several popular science books to share his theories of the history of the universe with the layperson.<em>His most popular book "A Brief History of Time" (10th-anniversary edition: Bantam, 1998) was first published in 1988 and became an international bestseller</em>. It has sold almost 10 million copies and has been translated into 40 different languages.<br><br>

    Hawking went on to write other nonfiction books aimed at non-scientists. These include "A Briefer History of Time," "The Universe in a Nutshell," "The Grand Design" and "On the Shoulders of Giants."<br> <br>

    Along with his many successful books about the inner workings of the universe, Hawking also began a series of   science fiction books called "George and the Big Bang", with his daughter Lucy Hawking in 2011. Aimed at middle school children, the series follows George's adventures as he travels through space.<br>
    
    <h3><u><heading>FILMOGRAPHY</heading></u></h3>
    Hawking has made several television appearances, including a playing hologram of himself on <em>"Star Trek: The Next Generation"</em> and <br>a <em>cameo on the television show "Big Bang Theory."</em><br> He has also <em>voiced himself in several episodes of the animated series "Futurama" and "The Simpson"</em>.<br> In 1997, Public Brodcasting Service also presented<em>an educational miniseries titled "Stephen Hawking's Universe"</em> which probes the theories of the cosmologist.<br>
    In 2014, a movie based on Hawking's life was released which is called <strong>"The Theory of Everything"</strong>, the film drew praise from Hawking, who said it made him reflect on his own life. "Although I'm severely disabled, I have been successful in my scientific work," Hawking wrote on Facebook in November 2014.<br> "I travel widely and have been to Antarctica and Easter Island, down in a submarine and up on a zero-gravity flight. One day, I hope to go into space." <br>
    
    <h3><u><heading>AWARDS AND HONORS</heading></u></h3> 
    Hawking received numerous awards and honors in recognition of his contributions to science. These include the Albert Einstein Award
    The Copley Medal and 
    The Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
    He was also a member of the Royal Society and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.<br>
    Hawking also won the prestigious Adams Prize for his essay entitled "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Tim<br><br>
